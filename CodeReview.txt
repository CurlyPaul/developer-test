OrangeBricks web site code review
=================================

The code demonstrates good SOC and SRP, and use of recognisable patterns such as Builders and Arrange/Act/Assert. 

The code uses dependency injection to allow for easy creation unit tests, using a Mocking framework to provide implementations of dependent objects.

Suggested Improvements
======================
The Properties controller also contains methods that are related to creating Offers. Semantically, this should be handled by the Offers controller I feel.

There are numerous methods that accept a parameter called "Id". To prevent confusion we should give these a more specific name, such as "propertyId".

Several of the cshtml files could benefit from using Display/Editor templates. For example MyProperites uses a foreach loop to generate the HTML of each property, a Display template could remove the foreach, separate the code into another file to help readability, and provide a way to reuse the view in other parts of the application.

The unit tests do not completely cover all areas and could be expanded to test more cases in the areas that they do cover.

Consider introducing a tool such as Automapper, which will map identically named properties inbewteen the database models, view models and command models without having to manually type them all out.
